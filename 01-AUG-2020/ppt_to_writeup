Always should assume our code will fail reminding that none is perfect.
Error should be Logged to server and not to console.caz its not the users to know the error. Its us the developers want to know the error.
When we caught an error we can add much more details to that error and leading that the developer have handled the error rather than not handling.
Types of error:
			coercion error,
			Data type error,
			communication error.
Communication error:
			url must be valid
			server response status
			no network connection
			server response content
server response status: not only 200 is valid status code. Also, 304 and 500 can also be considered.
NO network connection:  error will be thrown when ther is no network connection. that should also be handled.

eg:
				var req= new XMLHttpRequest();
				try{
				req.open("get","index.htm",true);
				}	
				catch(ex){
				//handles NETWORK ERROR.
				}								

				req.onreadystatechange = function(){
				if(req.readyState == 4){
				try{
					if((req.status>=200 && req.status <300) || req.status ==304){

					}
					else{
					//handles error other that 200 and 304
					}
				}
				catch(ex){
				//handles NETWORK ERROR
				}
				}
				}
Can throw our own errors using throw new Error("my error");
